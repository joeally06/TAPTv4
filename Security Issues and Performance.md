# Security Issues and Performance Improvements

## Security Issues

### 1. Exposure of Supabase Credentials in Client Code
- **Issue:** Supabase URL and anon key are exposed in client-side code (see [`src/lib/supabase.ts`](src/lib/supabase.ts), [`src/components/SupabaseConnectionTest.tsx`](src/components/SupabaseConnectionTest.tsx)).
- **Risk:** Anyone can see and use these credentials, which could allow abuse of public APIs or data.
- **Recommendation:** Move sensitive operations to server-side functions and restrict anon key permissions in Supabase.

### 2. Direct Role Escalation from Client
- **Issue:** Admin role can be assigned to users directly from the client (see [`src/components/AdminTestComponent.tsx`](src/components/AdminTestComponent.tsx)).
- **Risk:** If RLS or API validation is misconfigured, users could escalate their privileges.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure RLS policies strictly enforce admin role assignment and never allow role changes from the client.

### 3. Public Insert Policies
- **Issue:** Some tables (e.g., `hall_of_fame_nominations`, `membership_applications`) allow public inserts (see Supabase migrations).
- **Risk:** Potential for spam or abuse.
- **Recommendation:** Add rate limiting, CAPTCHA, or email verification for public submissions.

### 4. Insufficient Input Validation
- **Issue:** User input is sent directly to the database (see [`src/pages/AdminContent.tsx`](src/pages/AdminContent.tsx)).
- **Risk:** Risk of malformed or malicious data.
- **Recommendation:** Add comprehensive input validation on both client and server.

### 5. Use of `crypto.randomUUID()` in Client
- **Issue:** UUIDs are generated client-side for critical records (see [`src/pages/AdminTechConferenceSettings.tsx`](src/pages/AdminTechConferenceSettings.tsx), [`src/pages/AdminHallOfFameSettings.tsx`](src/pages/AdminHallOfFameSettings.tsx)).
- **Risk:** Potential for predictable or duplicate IDs.
- **Recommendation:** Prefer server-side or database-generated UUIDs for important records.

### 6. Error Message Disclosure
- **Issue:** Detailed error messages are shown to users (see [`src/components/SupabaseConnectionTest.tsx`](src/components/SupabaseConnectionTest.tsx)).
- **Risk:** May leak sensitive information.
- **Recommendation:** Show generic error messages to users and log details server-side.

### 7. Public Storage Bucket
- **Issue:** The storage bucket is public (see [`supabase/migrations/20250517000240_peaceful_hill.sql`](supabase/migrations/20250517000240_peaceful_hill.sql)).
- **Risk:** Anyone can access uploaded files.
- **Recommendation:** Restrict access if sensitive files are stored.

## Performance Improvements

### 1. Redundant Database Calls
- **Issue:** Multiple components fetch the same user/session data repeatedly.
- **Recommendation:** Cache session/user info in context or global state.

### 2. Inefficient Resource Loading
- **Issue:** No evidence of lazy loading or code splitting for large dependencies.
- **Recommendation:** Use dynamic imports for large libraries (e.g., PDF generation).

### 3. Database Indexing
- **Issue:** No explicit mention of indexes on frequently queried columns.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure indexes exist on columns used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses.

### 4. Unoptimized State Updates
- **Issue:** Some React components may trigger unnecessary re-renders.
- **Recommendation:** Use `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and proper dependency arrays in hooks.

### 5. Bulk Operations
- **Issue:** Some upserts/inserts are done one-by-one.
- **Recommendation:** Batch database operations where possible.

**Note:** These are recommendations based on a static review of the codebase and migrations. Actual risk and performance impact depend on deployment configuration and Supabase project settings.
